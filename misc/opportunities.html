<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><p>When it comes to Safety Within Artificial Intelligence Chatbots there are also many opportunities. These opportunities within chatbots include, elevating the user experience, reliability and user trust, increase efficiency, and expandability.
	<br><br>Improving user experience is a substantial opportunity when it comes to Al chatbots. In terms of a retail site having a chatbot is useful in providing information to a customer quickly 24/7 compared to a chatbot that is operated by humans. 
		‘For instance, an AI-chatbot assistant may help a customer to more quickly search for and find products, or provide essential information services, such as, about stock levels and delivery times.’ (Chong et al., 2021) 
		If the customer is able to get this information quickly then they are able to get make decisions faster when shopping.
	<br><br>Improving reliability and user trust would be a major opportunity as chatbots would be able to be used to handle sensitive information for things like shopping, creating bookings, and customer support. Improving the reliability of AI chatbots would allow the use of quick information at any time. 
		When it comes to a survey about ChatGPT done on 607 people that had a minimum of a high school diploma or a bachelor’s degree, they were asked questions that had to do with “Trust,” “Intent on Use,” and “Actual Use.” Choudhury & Shamszare, (2023) determined ‘that trust is critical to users adoption of ChatGPT.’
	<br><br>AI chatbots also give the opportunity to increase efficiency. This can include learners, educators, researchers, programmers and more. Learners are able to use AI chatbots as a ‘tool to understand and solve complex problems.’ (Rahman, 2023) 
		If a learner has tried to understand how to do something and still cannot, going to an AI chatbot can allow them to quickly gain the information they need to understand the task. This is compared to asking a human, could be a tutor or a teacher it can take some time for a response. 
		Educators are able to use AI chatbots to create detailed lesson plans, help with providing personalized learning support, and create assessments. Researchers are able to use AI chatbots to help remove errors in spelling and grammatical mistakes. 
		Finally, when it comes to programmers using AI chatbots it allows easy understanding and explanation of code, and also able to help with checking and fixing errors in code increasing efficiency when creating code.
	<br><br>Expandability is another opportunity for AI chatbots as it has a modular design, being able to connect with other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), using machine learning to improve the performance of the AI chatbots over time and be able to learn new information to gain a larger knowledge base. 
		AI chatbots are able to use APIs to expand into external services and data making it so that it can expand its capabilities by providing a wider range of functions. When it come to machine learning it allows the chatbot to learn overtime by analyzing user interactions and feedback. 
		This leads on to improving the performance of the AI chatbots by being able to identify patterns, and optimize responses resulting in more accurate and relevant interactions. 
		Finally expanding the capabilities of AI chatbots extends beyond enhancing performance through machine learning. It encompasses their capacity to acquire new information and broaden their knowledge repository. 
		Leveraging natural language processing and information retrieval techniques, chatbots can tap into extensive stores of data, including databases, documents, and websites. This empowers them to furnish users with timely and precise information across a broad spectrum of subjects. By continually updating their knowledge base, chatbots can remain in step with evolving information and offer users the most pertinent and trustworthy responses.
